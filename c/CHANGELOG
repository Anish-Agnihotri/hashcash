hashcash-0.30 - 04-Mar-2004 - Adam Back <adam@cypherspace.org>

	* make -cX check multiple X-Hashcash lines until it finds the
	  right one.  Bug reported by Kyle Hasselbacher <kyle@toehold.com>.

hashcash-0.29 - 04-Mar-2004 - Adam Back <adam@cypherspace.org>

	* fix prototype mismatch of function hashcash_check in
	  hashcash.h vs libhc.c which caused compile failure on
	  openBSD and freeBSD

	* change to make it compile on MAC OSX (need to recognize OSX
	  and treat as unix like for headers to include)

	* change to make it compile on solaris 9 (and POSIX / SVR
          systems in general).  Turns out putenv(3) is more portable
	  than setenv(3) / unsetenv(3)

	* update sha1 man page to name it sha1-hashcash to avoid collision
	  with openssl sha1(1).  By default with openssl there is not
	  actually any program named sha1, rather sha1 is a subprogram of
	  openssl invoked "openssl sha1".  However I think it may still be
	  possible to compile that as a separate program or symlink sha1 to
	  openssl to get that.

	* update sha1 man pages to refer to the other common sha1
	  implementations.

	* update LICENSE request

hashcash-0.28 - 18-Sep-2003 - Adam Back <adam@cypherspace.org>

	* fix bug with timezone handling reported by Joris Bontje
	  <jbontje@suespammers.org> (turns out utctime function is
	  redundant and wrong; time(2) gives time in UTCTime (doh)).
	  Reason for confusion is ctime is in local time, so converts
	  UTC time into local time even if you don't want that.  But
	  c-library time handling functions are really not designed
          for converting back from local to UTCTime when represented
          as a time_t.  Changed a bunch of time related stuff to fix
	  this up.

	* add -g flag for grace period suggested by Marc Lehmann
	  <pcg@goof.com> to avoid undue rejection of hashcash stamps
	  because of clock skew (or timezone / daylight savings time
	  off by one errors).  Default for email is 2 days (48 hours)
	  fast or slow.

	* change validity period default to 28 days; previous default
	  was forever which did not match recommended email default

	* add -z flag to explicitly specify the width in chars of the
	  time field.  This flag deprecates and overrides the -m -e
	  way to implicitly specify date field width.  As before the
	  default is 6 chars (date only in YYMMDD).

hashcash-0.27 - 11-Sep-2003 - Adam Back <adam@cypherspace.org>

	* add space char after 'X-Hashcash:' header that you get with
	  -X option

	* add LICENSE file

hashcash-0.26 - 26-Jun-2003 - Adam Back <adam@cypherspace.org>

	* accidentally folded in some non-standard VERBOSE output I was
	  playing with.  This change makes it really standard output
	  comparable to FIPS 180-1 appendices.

	* added a version number -- use -V to display it.  Also -v
	  (lowercase) by itself with no other arguments displays the
	  version umber also.

	* bug fix for quiet output (when not going to a pipe, still
	  need to see output!)

	* update everything to point at http://www.hashcash.org now we
	  have the domain courtesy of it's previous owner Ashish
	  Gulhati <agul@cpan.org> (at no charge -- he declined my
	  offer to pay for it and instead gave it to me!)

	* made a man page for sha1 utility also.

	* add -X option which is a shorthand version of -x 'X-Hashcash:'

	* remove leading and trailing blanks from hashcash tokens to
	  make them more robustly survive email transit.

hashcash-0.25 - 15-May-2003 - Adam Back <adam@cypherspace.org>

	* fix VERBOSE trace output of sha1 implementation to match FIPS
	  180-1 standard test vector examples (Note: this no impact on the
	  result, just allows direct comparison to the test vectors in
	  180-1).  The FIPS 180-1 VERBOSE output got broken when I unrolled
	  the rotates in the round function.

	* remove the automatic turning on of quiet mode if the output
	  is a pipe per note from Simon Josefsson <jas@extundo.com> about
	  how that can be inconvenient for scripting

hashcash-0.24 - 15-Mar-2003 - Adam Back <adam@cypherspace.org>

	* fix minor error which made hashcash_expected_tries a tiny
	  amount less efficient than realised

hashcash-0.23 - 15-Mar-2003 - Adam Back <adam@cypherspace.org>

	* fix error in libhc would always fail in hashcash_check
	  reported by Alan Barclay <gorilla@elaine.furryape.com>; note this
	  bug does not affect the hashcash command line tool as it does not
	  use this API

	* minor Makefile changes

hashcash-0.22 - 16-Aug-2002 - Adam Back <adam@cypherspace.org>
