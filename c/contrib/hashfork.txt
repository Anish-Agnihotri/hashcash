hashfork.c and hashfork.py are contributed code by Hubert Chan
<hubert@uhoreg.ca> and is useful for getting faster minting
performance from multi-processor machines.  They are wrappers (in C
and python respectively) around the hashcash executable.

Known limitations: they make assumptions about location of hashcash
executable, and the arguments you would like to pass.  Look at the
source for details.
