To compile type:

	make

to see a list of platforms.  Current platforms are:

	x86, g3-osx, ppc-linux, generic

Choose platform (or generic if your platform is not listed) and then
type:

	make <platform>

To install the compiled binaries type:

	make install

This will install the binaries sha1 and hashcash in /usr/local/bin,
and the man page hashcash.1 in /usr/local/man/man1.

To change the binary installation location change the INSTALL_PATH in
the Makefile.  To change the man page installation location change the
MAN_INSTALL_PATH in the Makefile.

For usage information see the man page.

To override the CFLAGS argument without editing the Makefile do:

	make "CFLAGS=-DREGEXP_POSIX -O3 -myflags"

(choose appropriate REGEXP approach for your system, default
REGEXP_POSIX, alternative REGEXP_BSD, or fall back to neither
defined if your system doesn't have REGEXP.)
